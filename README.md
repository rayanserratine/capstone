Capstone Project: Many Money

Author: Rayan Serratine

Problem Statement

Many Money is an application that helps users manage their incomes, spends, and savings. The bank credit system isnâ€™t great, and it is easy to get lost when managing your money.

Overview

The application will have different sections to navigate. Users can manually create sections such as:

Income
Regular Job
Side Job
Passive (Investments)

The app will generate graphics to help users better manage their finances. At the end of the year, for example, users will understand what spending needs to be reduced to allocate more money for goals like travel.
